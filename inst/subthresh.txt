This document attempts to explain the different 'subthreshHandling' methods of mhclust()


## Intro

The Mahalanobis distance heavily depends on the (inverse) covariance
matrix defining the distortion of space around a cluster. For
relatively large clusters, this matrix can be estimated quite
precisely. However, for small clusters, the covariance matrix can't be
estimated easily, which negatively affects the Mahalanobis distance
computed with respect to such clusters. 

Therefore, small clusters should be treated in a special way, which is
controlled using the 'subthreshHandling' argument to mhclust(). This
argument defines how  the size and shape of clusters that have not
reached the desired cardinality limit (computed as 'thresh' * N,
where 'thresh' is an argument to mhclust() and N is the total number of
data samples) affect the distance measures. See the help for the
'subthreshHandling' argument to learn details.

Basically, when one is not interested in the structure of
subthreshold clusters, they should use one of 'euclid' or
'euclidMahal' methods, which, however, could yield non-intuitive
results (se below). Generally, the 'mahal' method works
quite well and is taken as the default.


## Demo data

To explore the different methods, we demonstrate possible methods of 
'subthreshHandling' on several toy data sets in demos 'subthreshX.R'
located in the 'demo/' directory.

Here, we briefly make several observations how the particular
methods of 'subthreshHandling' behave for some synthetic data. 
See the subthreshX.png pictures and correspoding demos to learn
details. Each data set consists of three clusters with possible
internal structure. 

The first two data sets consist of three clusters of 50 samples each.
The threshold is set to 1/3, i.e. clusters of less than 50 samples
are considered to be subthreshold. 

The third data set consists of three clusters of 40 samples each. 
The threshold is set to 1/3, i.e. clusters of less than 40 samples are
considered to be subthreshold. 

The fourth data set consists of three clusters: two are of 100 samples,
one of 40 samples. The threshold is set to 100/240, i.e. clusters of
less than 100 samples are considered to be subthreshold. 


## Figures overview:

Each figure presents a single toy data set on three 
different scales (in rows) and processed by the four different methods 
(columns). The figure consists of a panel of dot plots enriched with
dendrograms. 

Note that in Fig. 1, the 'euclid' method gives non-intuitive results
(1G) since it ignores the shape of clusters until all clusters are of
super-threshold size. In this particaulr case, the two black clusters
get merged before the red an green clusters are, because the black
clusters are closer in the euclidean distance sense.

Note that in Fig. 2, the 'mahal0' method yields results which depend on
the scale of data (2E vs. 2F) and that the 'euclidMahal' can yield
non-intuitive results (2J) (because the two vlack clusters are
effectively closer to each other compared to the red and green ones).

Note that in Fig. 3, the internal structure of the subthreshold cluster
(on the left side) is not appreciated by the 'euclid' and 'euclidMahal'
methods, but it gets recognized by the 'mahal' method.

Note that in Fig. 4, the central spherical cluster gets attracted
towards the narrow cluster at the top when using (at least
partially) the Mahalanobis distance, but it gets attracted to the
cluster at the bottom when forcing to use the pure Euclidean distance 
(because of the central cluster is still of subthreshold size, the
'euclid' method enforces using Euclidean distance only).



## Discussion on the 'subthreshHandling' methods

The original 'mahal0' method is not independent on the scale of the
clustered data (see Fig. 2E vs. 2F, 3D vs. 3E).

The 'mahal' method is independent on the scale of the clustered data
and gives quite satisfactory / intuitive results.

The 'euclid' method can merge clusters close to each other in a
non-inutitively way, ignoring their shape (see Fig. 1G) just because
the Mahalanobis distance is not being used yet. (The reason is that
there are still other subthreshold clusters that force using the
Euclidean distance only. In these situations, the 'euclidMahal' method
can help.)

The 'euclidMahal' method can also yield non-inutitive results (see Fig.
2J) - it can merge two clusters (in black) that are far from each other
before another cluster (in red) gets formed - this is because when
using the Mahalanobis distance, the two black clusters are effectively
closer to each other compared to the red and green ones.


## Conclusion

One should carefully set the 'thresh' and 'subthreshHandling'
arguments to mhclust(). Usually, the default 'mahal' method of
'subthreshHandling' works well.
